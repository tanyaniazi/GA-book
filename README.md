# GA-book
I code here for fun, reviewing and practicing my python skills everyday, based on reading the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava

in the binary_search1.py file, there exists the codes of guess game where the computer asks the user to give an interval, and give an input as the answer, and the computer tries to guess the number by getting feedbacks from the user. computer tries to guess the answer by chppsing a random number each time in the updated interval.

in the binary_search2.py the algorithm of finding the answer is different, the computer finds and returns the middle of the interval as the answer.
